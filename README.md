# MatplotLibGraphing
The API Provides two main Functions:

1. Create a Single graph in 1 window with scaled X and Y Axis. 
  - Calling the graph_single(...) function with correct parameters would result in the desired graph.
2. Create two graphs in the same window with synchronized X Axis and scaled Y Axis.
  - Calling the graph_double(...) function with correct parameters would result in the desired graph.
  
Enjoy :)
